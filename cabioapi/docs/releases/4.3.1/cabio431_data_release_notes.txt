=============================

4 Known Issues 

================ 

Refer to caBIO 4.3.1 Software Release Notes 



4.2 Known Data Issues 

====================== 

1) GF12098: Histopathology Data. 

Some caBIO Genes are associated with Histopathology data for which insufficient information is 
available 

 

2) GF12812: Inconsistent data from Gene to Library 

caBIO's Library object integrates Clone libraries from multitudes of sources like Unigene, ORESTS, etc, 
as provided by CGAP. 

Gene -> Library associates all EST Libraries from CGAP with relevant caBIO Genes.  

 

However CloneRelativeLocation is available only for those Clones used to construct Unigene. 

Hence the number of Libraries associated with a given Gene as obtained by traversing the path Gene 
-> NucleicAcidSequence -> CloneRelativeLocation -> Clone -> Library may be different from those 
obtained by traversing the path Gene -> Library 

   

3) GF13321 : Standardize on one dataset for associating Entrez with Unigene. 

caBIO associates Entrez with Unigene using two different datasets (Entrez's gene2unigene and 
Unigene's data files). These two data-files are updated asynchronously, with the former being more 
current.  

Entrez's dataset is used to associate Unigene to OMIM, obtain Gene Physical Locations as well as 
retrieve caBIO Gene Ids to make Gene-Disease or Gene-Agent associations from the CGDC dataset.  

References to Entrez Ids in Unigene files are used to populate 
DatabaseCrossReference.CrossReferenceId. 
 

This may lead to caBIO Genes being associated with Entrez Gene Ids which may not have 
corresponding OMIM Identifiers, Physical Locations, Gene-Disease or Gene-Agent associations. 


4) GF13595 : It returns different results from Gene to ExpressionArrayReporter through different 
paths. 


Affymetrix uses Genbank sequences as representative sequences for its probes. 

Some of these Genbank sequences are not used to build Unigene and hence are not available 
through caBIO's NucleicAcidSequence object. 

Thus associations from NucleicAcidSequence to ExpressionReporter are available only for those 
probes whose representative public sequence-id is sequence also available as part of Unigene.   


On the other hand, Gene -> ExpressionReporter association is made on the basis of the Unigene Id. 


Thus the results of the Gene-ExpressionReporter associations may differ from those obtained by 
traversing the path Gene->NucleicAcidSequence->ExpressionReporter  


5) High Frequency Cancer Index Genes : Certain High Frequency Genes are to be curated in the next 
phase of the Cancer Gene Index Project.  For now, these uncurated gene-disease and disease-agent 
associations are available at  

https://gforge.nci.nih.gov/docman/index.php?group_id=51&selected_doc_group_id=3387&language
_id=1 


6) GF17865: Missing NCI-Nature pathway interaction links. These missing links will be addressed in 
the next data refresh for caBIO.
