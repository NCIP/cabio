      Once you have created a query, you can create a report that is based on that
      query. The report is based on your query in that each row of your report
      will describe the object that you initially selected when creating your query.
      <p>
      On this page, you can either create a new report or work with an existing one.
      To create a new report, select the query on which it will be based from the
      drop-down list in step <i>A</i>, on the left, under <i>Create A New Report</i>.
      The give your new report a name. Finally, press create. You'll then see an interface
      for designing your report.
      <p>

      drop-down list in step <i>A</i>, on the left, under <i>Work With An Existing Report</i>.
