Welcome to the caBIO Project!
=====================================

The cancer Bioinformatics Infrastructure Objects (caBIO) model and architecture was the first model-driven information system built using caCORE, a synthesis of software, vocabulary, and metadata models for cancer research. Each of the caBIO domain objects represents an entity found in biomedical research such as Gene, Chromosome, Sequence, SNP, Library, Clone, and Pathway. Examining the relationships between these objects can reveal biomedical knowledge that was previously buried in the various primary data sources. Given the dynamic nature of this information, the data in caBIO is updated on a monthly basis through a series of ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) processes.

The caBIO data can be accessed via a variety of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) as well as a web user interface called the caBIO Portlet, which you can access through the caGrid Portal (for more information on the caGrid Portal, see http://cagridportal.nci.nih.gov/). The system also provides a number of utilities to search for and manipulate data objects programmatically.

The caBIO system is primarily a repository of molecular biology data; the entities that concern the central dogma of molecular biology are the core of this model. Data for these classes come from a variety of sources. For a full list of primary data sources, see https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/ICR/caBIO+Data+Sources
