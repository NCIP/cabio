Welcome to the caBIO Project!
=====================================The caBIO doman model and architecture is an effort to model the rapidly-changing genomics and proteomics domain and to integrate data from numerous sources providing a holistic view of the human and mouse genomes.

The caBIO data can be accessed via a variety of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) as well as a web user interface called the caBIO Portlet, which you can access through the caGrid Portal (for more information on the caGrid Portal, see http://cagridportal.nci.nih.gov/). The system also provides a number of utilities to search for and manipulate data objects programmatically.

The caBIO system is primarily a repository of molecular biology data; the entities that concern the central dogma of molecular biology are the core of this model. Data for these classes come from a variety of sources. For a full list of primary data sources, see https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/ICR/caBIO+Data+Sources

The caBIO is  written in Java using caGrid, caCORE CSM, caCORE SDK, Struts, Tiles, Hibernate, Spring Framework, Lucene technologies.
