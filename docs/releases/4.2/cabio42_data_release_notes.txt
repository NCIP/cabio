4.2 Known Data Issues
======================
1) GF12098: Histopathology Data.
Some caBIO Genes are associated with Histopathology data for which insufficient information is available

2) GF12812: Inconsistent data from Gene to Library
caBIO's Library object integrates Clone libraries from multitudes of sources like Unigene, ORESTS, etc, as provided by CGAP.
Gene -> Library associates all EST Libraries from CGAP with relevant caBIO Genes. 

However CloneRelativeLocation is available only for those Clones used to construct Unigene.
Hence the number of Libraries associated with a given Gene as obtained by traversing the path Gene -> NucleicAcidSequence -> CloneRelativeLocation -> Clone -> Library may be different from those obtained by traversing the path Gene -> Library
 

3) GF13321 : Standardize on one dataset for associating Entrez with Unigene.
caBIO associates Entrez with Unigene using two different datasets (Entrez's gene2unigene and Unigene's data files). These two data-files are updated asynchronously, with the former being more current. 
Entrez's dataset is used to associate Unigene to OMIM, obtain Gene Physical Locations as well as retrieve caBIO Gene Ids to make Gene-Disease or Gene-Agent associations from the CGDC dataset. 
References to Entrez Ids in Unigene files are used to populate DatabaseCrossReference.CrossReferenceId.

This may lead to caBIO Genes being associated with Entrez Gene Ids which may not have corresponding OMIM Identifiers, Physical Locations, Gene-Disease or Gene-Agent associations.
 
4) GF13595 : It returns different results from Gene to ExpressionArrayReporter through different paths.

Affymetrix uses Genbank sequences as representative sequences for its probes.
Some of these Genbank sequences are not used to build Unigene and hence are not available through caBIO's NucleicAcidSequence object.
Thus associations from NucleicAcidSequence to ExpressionReporter are available only for those probes whose representative public sequence-id is sequence also available as part of Unigene.  
 
On the other hand, Gene -> ExpressionReporter association is made on the basis of the Unigene Id.

Thus the results of the Gene-ExpressionReporter associations may differ from those obtained by traversing the path Gene->NucleicAcidSequence->ExpressionReporter 

5) GF17381 : Gene-Marker association 
caBIO obtains UniSTS Markers associated with Human and Mouse genes from Unigene dump files. But build 215 in caBIO does not have these associations, causing some associations to be lost. Currently these associations have been made on the basis of Genbank accession numbers provided as a part of UniSTS

6) GF16794 : Marker Relative Location mixup
For the same probeset, the SLM1 and deCODE genetic Map values in caBIO are swapped as compared to those at NetAffyx on account of a mixup in the annotations files from Affymetrix that would be fixed in their next update in November.  


7) High Frequency Cancer Index Genes : Certain High Frequency Genes are to be curated in the next phase of the Cancer Gene Index Project.  For now, these uncurated gene-disease and disease-agent associations are available at 
https://gforge.nci.nih.gov/docman/index.php?group_id=51&selected_doc_group_id=3387&language_id=1

8) GF17865: Missing NCI-Nature pathway interaction links. These missing links will be addressed in the next data refresh for caBIO.
