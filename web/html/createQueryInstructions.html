      BIOgopher enables you to build complex queries against caBIO datasources. The
      result of running these queries will be a spreadsheet. To start building
      your query you must first decide, <em>which
      caBIO object will be the subject of each row in your final spreadsheet?</em>
      This will be the object that you select from the drop-down list in step <em>A</em>,
      on the left.
      <p>
      Since you could create more than one query during your session, you must give
      each new query a name, preferably something meaningful. Type this name into
      the textbox in step <em>B</em>, on the left. Then, press <em>Create</em>, to
      begin designing your query.

      When you point your browser to BIOgopher, you begin a <em>session</em>.
      A BIOgopher session lasts until either you close your browser or you don't
      do anything with BIOgopher for three hours.
      <p>
      Within your session, you can create as many queries as you
      like. Once your session ends, your queries will be erased.
      <p>
      To work with an existing query, select it from the drop-down list in
      step <em>A</em> of the <em>Work With An Existing Query</em> section,
      to the left. Then, press one of the buttons in step <em>B</em>.
