      To design a report, you start with the tree on the left. This tree displays
      the object that will be described by each row of your report. Underneath that
      object are its attributes, the objects associated with it, and their attributes.
      You can indicate that you would like data about any of those objects
      to be included in your report by clicking on their attributes.
      <p>
      A preview of your report will be displayed in the bottom panel of this page.
      As you select attributes from the tree on the left, columns corresponding to
      those attributes will be dynamically added to the report preview. The buttons
      on each column in the report preview allow you to reorder, rename, or remove a
      particular column.
      <p>
      Once you are satisfied with your report design, you can generate the report by
      pressing the <i>Generate Report</i> button in the preview panel. A separate
      window will appear in which your report will be displayed.
      <p>
      <b>Note:</b> it may
      take several minutes, depending on the complexity of your query, for your report
      to be generated. In general, the larger the spreadsheet you supply, the longer it
      will take to generate a report.
      <p>
      While the report is generating, you can go on using BIOgopher to do other things.
      You can even close the main BIOgopher window. But don't close the separate window
      in which your report will be displayed.
