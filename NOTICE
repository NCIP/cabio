This project was developed as part of the NCI caBIG initiative.

The cancer Bioinformatics Infrastructure Objects (caBIO) model and architecture was the first model-driven information system built using caCORE, a synthesis of software, vocabulary, and metadata models for cancer research. Each of the caBIO domain objects represents an entity found in biomedical research such as Gene, Chromosome, Sequence, SNP, Library, Clone, and Pathway.

The project was initially developed by Science Applications International Corporation ("SAIC") under funding from the CBIIT office of the National Cancer Institute.

In 2013, as part of the National Cancer Informatics Program (NCIP) Open Development Initiative, 
the caBIO source code was migrated to GitHub to allow further development by the broader community.
